"""A stable fingerprint of smda's observable escaping behaviour.

MinHashes are derived from smda's *escaped* instruction representation: the shinglers build their
tokens from `SmdaInstruction.getMnemonicGroup()` and `SmdaInstruction.getEscapedOperands()`. That
makes the escaper as much an input to a minhash as MINHASH_SEED is - but unlike the seed it lives
in a separate, independently versioned package, and it is not covered by any config hash. When
smda changes how it escapes, previously stored minhashes silently stop being comparable to newly
computed ones: they remain valid-looking and still match each other, while identical code
submitted afterwards no longer finds them.

smda 4.4.5 is the worked example. It corrected three escaper classifications - most notably it
stopped escaping segment-qualified memory operands (`gs:[0x60]`, `fs:[0x30]`, `es:[edi]`) as
CONST - which changed roughly a fifth of the minhashes on a real corpus, with a small share of
functions losing every LSH band and becoming unretrievable. The change was correct; the problem is
that nothing announced it.

This module runs the escaper over a fixed, committed probe of instructions chosen to exercise the
operand and mnemonic classes escaping actually distinguishes, and hashes the result. Comparing the
fingerprint across smda versions turns "escaping changed" from an invisible condition into a
value that can be recorded, exported and compared.

The probe deliberately depends on as little of smda as possible: `SmdaInstruction` is constructed
directly from four-field lists (offset, bytes, mnemonic, operands), so no report, binary or
disassembly is needed and the fingerprint is computable at import time.

# Probe instructions as [offset, bytes, mnemonic, operands], the same four-field form used in

# are realistic so that byte-level escaping (jump/call targets, ptr refs, immediates) also runs.
# Every architecture MCRIT computes minhashes for is probed (#93). The non-Intel probes are taken
# from real code - one instruction per distinct escaped form, from the cross-architecture test
# fixtures, for ARM from smda's own A32/Thumb fixtures, and, for Dalvik, from an app with its class
# names and strings replaced by neutral ones that escape identically. An smda without an ARM
# escaper fingerprints ARM as unavailable and leaves the others as they are.
# Adding instructions to an architecture's probe changes that architecture's fingerprint, so only
# do so at a deliberate version boundary; adding an architecture leaves the others' unchanged.
